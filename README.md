# Neural 1 Documentation

This repository contains all documentation, design specifications, research notes, and internal planning materials for the Neural 1 AGI architecture.

## Purpose

Neural 1 aims to build a modular, general-purpose artificial intelligence capable of autonomous reasoning, long-term memory formation, and adaptive learning across domains.

This documentation serves as the canonical source for:

- System architecture design
- Module-level specifications
- Internal research references
- Development roadmap and release planning
- Public-facing materials (vision, philosophy, governance)

| Document                   | Description                                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `MANIFESTO.md`             | Foundational philosophy and AGI design principles |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md`          | System-level blueprint and module relationships   |
| `ROADMAP.md`               | Milestones, timelines, and feature prioritization |
| `EXPERIMENTS.md`           | Logs and outcomes of cognitive experiments        |
| `AGI_ETHICS.md`            | Governance, transparency, and risk considerations |

## Standards

All documentation is structured for clarity, version control, and public transparency when appropriate. Updates to core specifications should be proposed via pull request and reviewed by maintainers.

## Status

This repository is actively maintained in parallel with all Neural 1 development streams. Contributions and research updates are welcomed from collaborators.
